i'm a high school student and fan of biochemistry (along with other things)

I'm a student on Pearadox 5414, you can typically find me in the 3d printing corner... 3d printing things. In addition to that, I'm a data science aficionado (not really, but I'm good with making stuff in R). I'm also participating in NASA's GL4HS summer training program hosted virtually at the Ames Research Center. Next year, I'll be taking AP Chemistry, AP Physics, APUSH, APLAC, French 3, AP Precalc, and Art!
