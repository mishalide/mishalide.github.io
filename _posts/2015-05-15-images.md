this is a small snapshot of some data visualisation using R for FRC!! a (much) longer blogpost with more insights coming... sometime soon!

The data was obtained via a modified version of @Ta0shan's script to get attrition data from The Blue Alliance. Darker colors indicate higher attrition (which is bad!). Originally it was colored by metro area but that got messy very quickly, so it's colored by county now (if the county had no data I didn't display its borders to make the map cleaner).

<div class="row mt-3">
  <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/attrition-rate-data.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
  </div>
</div>
